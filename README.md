Contribution Guide
=============

  * Follow the general style found through-out the project as consistantly as possible.
  * Always use tabs, not spaces, and include a blank line at the end of each source file.
  * There's no enforced line length limit, but a good rule of thumb is to keep it short, and use whitespace and newlines where possible.
